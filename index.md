This is a portfolio web site showcasing some of my work as well as various collaborations with different collectives. 

My research areas take shape at the intersection of urban studies and disaster studies: Dealing with themes such as memory, victims, violence, risk, aid, and housing.

My current fieldwork focuses on the (re)construction practices in the post-disaster territory of Turkey's eastern Marmara region, which was devasted by two earthquakes in 1999.
