Hello, I am Gürhan Camgöz. This is a portfolio web site showcasing some of my work as well as various collaborations. 

My research areas take shape at the intersection of urban studies and disaster studies: Dealing with themes such as memory, victims, violence, risk, aid, and housing; employing an anthropological lens to initiate a critique of capitalist catastrophism. My current fieldwork focuses on the (re)construction activities in the post-disaster territory of Turkey's eastern Marmara region, which was devasted by dual earthquakes in 1999.
